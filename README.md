# 📦 Project: Lollypop Shop

**Lollypop Shop** is a simple and modern candy store web application built with **Vue 3** and **Vite**.

It demonstrates:

* 🛒 Product listing and detail pages (static catalog data)
* 🛍️ Shopping cart with localStorage persistence
* ❤️ Favorites with localStorage persistence
* 🌟 Responsive UI built with Naive UI

---

# 🚀 Technologies Used

* [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) (Composition API)
* [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
* [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) for state management
* [Naive UI](https://www.naiveui.com/) for components
* LocalStorage for cart & favorites persistence

# Project Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Environment:

* Optional: Netlify function `netlify/functions/send-preorder.js` uses AWS SES and expects `EMAIL_FROM`, `EMAIL_TO`, `SES_REGION`.
* No Firebase/Auth configuration is required (all data is static).
